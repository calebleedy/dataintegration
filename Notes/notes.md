# Recap and To Do

## Comment on Yang and Kim (2020)

Today I read [[1]](#1) which is a review paper for data
integration techniques. This paper has several good examples about how to
integrate different types of data and I would like to experiment with all of
these options. While I am pretty busy at the moment, I think that I will have
more time (maybe?) over the summer when I can implement several of these
existing approaches. See my [recap](../../Literature/yang2020statistical.tex)
for more information.

Overall, I think that I would skip integration for two probability samples and
focus on how to integrate multiple data sets where one of them is a probability
sample. However, the more interesting part is how to integrate the ''big'' data
sets. If we have additional constraints on the data (large $n$ or $p$) then the
problem becomes more interesting.

This is related to this project because our plan is to use the nonmonotone
measure to combine multiple nonprobability data sets with a probability sample.
