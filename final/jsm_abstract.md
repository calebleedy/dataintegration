Generalized Least Squares in Non-Monotone Missing Data

# Abstract

Non-monotone missingness occurs when there is no sequential pattern of missing
variables in a dataset. This makes the imputation procedure challenging because
there is no definitive order for how the variables should be imputed. One common
setting in which to have non-monotone missing data is when combining information
from different surveys or data sets. While there is not closed form for the
optimal estimator for the general non-monotone imputation problem, we consider
combining design consistent estimators using generalized least squares, which is
optimal in the class of linear estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach via simulation and apply this work to estimation of the National
Resources Inventory (NRI).
