# Data Integration

The goal of this project is to be able to merge multiple (non-probability) data 
sets with a probability sample and still have valid estimates for the joint
distributions of the variables. We use the non-monotone framework of Robins and
Gill [[1]](#1) to create a method for incorporating different data sets.


## Tasks

See [TODO.md](TODO.md).
