# Data Integration

The goal of this project is to be able to merge multiple (non-probability) data 
sets with a probability sample and still have valid estimates for the joint
distributions of the variables. We use the non-monotone framework of Robins and
Gill [[1]](#1) to create a method for incorporating different data sets.

For now, we are going to focus on the nonmonotone missingness theory because we
want to also apply this methodology to the NRI imputation procedure.

## Tasks
