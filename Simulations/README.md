# Outline of Simulations/ Directory
This document gives insight about how the `Simulations/` directory is 
structured. 

1. Paper_Replications: Code replicating the results of other 
existing papers.
2. T1Comparing_Estimator_Types: Code to compare calibration, multiphase, and 
other estimators in the non-monotone case.
3. T2Optimal_Nonmonotone_Est: Code to test and find the optimal estimator 
when combining multiple samples with non-monotone missingness.

The numbers `T1` and `T2` refer to the project level README order of tasks.
