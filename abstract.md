# Abstract


An open question in the literature is how to obtain a closed form semiparametric
estimator for non-monotone data (Tsiatis 2006). In this paper, we compute an
optimal linear estimator which we construct from a set of design-consistent
estimators. This estimate uses a generalized least squares (GLS) framework. We
prove that it is optimal within a class of linear estimators and apply it to
estimation of the National Resources Inventory (NRI).
